正式与非正式商务邮件常用语
 
Whether you're writing to friends, colleagues or to a potential business partner, your main goal is to get your message across, in other words, to ensure the recipient understands you.
无论你是给朋友、同事还是潜在的商业伙伴写信，你的主要目标都是让你的信息传达出去，换句话说，确保收件人理解你。

If you use improper or incorrect language and continuously make mistakes in your e-mail, not only might you fail to make yourself understood, you might also fail to make a good impression on the reader. To avoid this, you can run your e-mail through a grammar and spell checker, however, this in itself won't guarantee that you're using the right words and expressions.
如果你使用不恰当或不正确的语言，并在电子邮件中不断地犯错误，不仅可能使你自己无法被理解，还可能给读者留下不好的印象。为了避免这种情况，您可以通过语法和拼写检查器运行电子邮件，但是，这本身并不能保证您使用了正确的单词和表达式。

Use: Grammarly grammar and spell checker
用法：语法和拼写检查器

In this article, you'll find examples of language that are commonly used in different types of emails, and hopefully, you'll find the most appropriate one for your message. The examples are labelled 'formal' and 'informal'- please note that most informal expressions are perfectly suitable to use in 'semi-formal' situations, such as between business associates who have worked together for some time and have established a good relationship.
在本文中，您将找到在不同类型的电子邮件中常用的语言示例，希望您能找到最适合您的邮件的语言。这些例子被称为“正式的”和“非正式的”——请注意，大多数非正式的表达方式非常适合在“半正式的”情况下使用，例如在一起工作了一段时间并建立了良好关系的商业伙伴之间。

10. 其他：
One more thing to keep in mind is that in formal correspondence contractions are rarely used, so remember to write 'I do not' instead of 'I don't' or 'they cannot' instead of 'they can't' and so on. Keep learning, keep writing – practice makes perfect – and let me know if I can help you with anything.
还有一点要记住的是，在正式的通信中很少使用缩略词，所以记住写“我不”而不是“我不”或“他们不能”而不是“他们不能”等等。继续学习，继续写作-熟能生巧-如果我能帮你什么，请告诉我。
